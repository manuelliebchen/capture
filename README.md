# Capture!

A minimal working example for a game programmed with the [apcf](https://github.com/manuelliebchen/apcf).
It is a simple game where the agent has to capture a flag befor any other agent.
The game was writen in 2h, so do not expect to much.

To run the game use gradle to build and run it.
`gradle run`
